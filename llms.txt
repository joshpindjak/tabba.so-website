# Tabba

> A privacy-first Chrome extension that replaces your new tab with a visual time grid and productivity tools

## Overview

Tabba is a Chrome extension that transforms your new tab page into a powerful productivity workspace centered around a unique visual time grid. Every time you open a new tab, you see your time laid out visually—hours, days, weeks, months, and quarters—helping you feel more present, aware, and in control.

## Core Philosophy

- **Privacy-First**: All data stored locally in your browser. Zero tracking, no external servers, no data collection.
- **Self-Hosted**: Everything runs in your browser using Chrome's storage APIs. Delete the extension, your data goes with it.
- **Minimal & Fast**: Clean design, quick load times, no bloat. Built for performance.
- **No Account Required**: No sign-up, no login, no sync. Just install and use.
