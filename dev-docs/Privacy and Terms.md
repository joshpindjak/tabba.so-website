## Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 8, 2024**

### The Short Version

Tabba respects your privacy. The extension stores everything locally on your device—we never see your data. Our website uses basic analytics to understand traffic, and we only collect your email if you join the waitlist or send us feedback.

### What Tabba Collects

**The Extension (Tabba Chrome Extension):**
- Nothing. Zero. All your notes, tasks, bookmarks, and settings are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's built-in storage.
- We don't track what you do, we don't send your data anywhere, and we can't access it even if we wanted to.
- If you delete the extension, all your data goes with it.

**The Website (tabba.so):**
- We use Umami Analytics (a privacy-focused analytics service) to understand how people use our website—things like page views, referrers, and general location.
- Umami is GDPR compliant and doesn't use cookies or collect personal data.
- No individual users are tracked or identified.

**Waitlist:**
- If you join our waitlist, we collect your email address via Formspree. We use this only to notify you about Tabba updates and launches.
- We'll never sell or share your email with anyone.
- You can unsubscribe anytime.

**Feedback & Bug Reports:**
- If you submit feedback or bug reports via our Google Form, you can optionally provide your email address. This helps us follow up if needed.
- Providing your email is completely optional.

### Your Data, Your Control

- **Export:** You can export all your Tabba data as a JSON file anytime from the extension's settings.
- **Delete:** Delete individual items or wipe everything clean in seconds.
- **No Account Required:** Tabba doesn't require sign-up, login, or any account. There's nothing to manage.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. If we make significant changes, we'll let you know via the website or extension update notes.

## Terms of Service

**Last updated: December 8, 2024**

### The Deal

By using Tabba, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use Tabba.

### What Tabba Is

Tabba is a free Chrome extension that replaces your new tab page with a visual time grid, note-taking tools, and productivity features. It's built for people who want a better new tab experience without sacrificing privacy.

### What You Can Do

- Use Tabba for personal or commercial purposes
- Modify your local data however you want
- Share Tabba with others
- Export your data anytime

### What You Can't Do

- Redistribute Tabba as your own product
- Reverse engineer the extension to harm others
- Use Tabba for anything illegal
- Hold us responsible if something goes wrong (see below)

### No Warranty

Tabba is provided "as is" without any guarantees. We've built it with care, but software can have bugs. We're not responsible for any data loss, missed meetings, or forgotten tasks.

**Translation:** Use Tabba at your own risk. Back up important data. Don't rely solely on Tabba for critical reminders.

### Your Responsibility

- You're responsible for backing up your data (use the export feature!)
- You're responsible for keeping your device secure
- If you encounter bugs, please report them so we can fix them

### Limitation of Liability

We're not liable for any damages arising from your use of Tabba. This includes lost data, lost time, missed deadlines, or any other indirect damages.

**Translation:** We can't be held legally responsible if Tabba doesn't work perfectly. It's a free tool built by a small team.

### Changes to Tabba

We may add, modify, or remove features at any time. We'll do our best to avoid breaking changes, but sometimes they're necessary.

### Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms occasionally. Continued use of Tabba means you accept the updated terms.
